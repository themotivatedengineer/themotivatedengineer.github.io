Its just beautiful what we can do with electronics. We built a circuit that could play the game <a id="qlink_ch3mj0kph1" class="qlink qtext_editor_link_text" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.stickhero&amp;hl=en" data-link-text="Android Apps on Google Play" data-link-delete="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ketchapp.stickhero&amp;hl=en">Stick Hero</a>Â on an Android tablet. This circuit could break world record score by humans.

If you haven't played the game yet, have a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E97BeH6WYlo" target="_blank">gameplay video</a>.

And here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJW59UliLhc" target="_blank">video</a> of our circuit playing the game.

We have a tutorial of this coming up next week, subscribe to our YouTube channel for more updates- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/suryapenmetsa?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank">The Motivated Engineer</a>.
